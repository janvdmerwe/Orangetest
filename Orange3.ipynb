    "## Introduction and structure of data\n",
    "This study is based on a data set published by Gartner in Q4 2024. The study includes 3 years of history and 9 years of forecast across 192 countries.\n",
    "All units are presented in thousands and revenues in millions of USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gartner has structured the data by \"Endpoint\", which represents a type of IoT device. Endpoints can be used in multiple different \"Use Cases\" in several different \"Sectors\". We will use this structure in our representation of the data. See the example below of the \"Commercila Drone\" Endpoint for an illustration of how the structure works.\n",
